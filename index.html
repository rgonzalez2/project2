		<p2>Art is just art, right? Everyone sees art in their own way. You can stare at it for hours upon hours and still don't understand what you're looking at. Some people look at art and make it deeper than it needs to be. But every art piece has a deeper meaning and purpose behind it. Which Claude Monet has quite the story for each of his pieces.</p2>
		
		<center><p3>This website will show you not only who Claude Monet is but what his pieces mean for everyone else.</p3></center>
