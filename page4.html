	<center><p8>"People discuss my art and pretend to understand as if it were necessary to understand, when it's simply necessary to love."
	
	In this quote by Claude Monet he states that you don't have to understand his pieces but to instead love it. This website isn't here to bash on you for not taking a longer time to really take in the beauty of art. This website is just here to inform you that art is something precious. Art is something that one should love, not criticize. </p8></center>
	
	<center><p9>Why consider everything you've just been told?? Art is the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. (Stated by Google) You see? Art is something powerful that comes from the mind. The mind of not only Claude Monet but the mind for any other artist is something so genuine and something so talented. All in all, appreciate the arts!</p9></center>
	
	<center><p10>"Try to forget what objects you have before you - a tree, a house, a field, or whatever. Merely think, 'Here is a little square of blue, here an oblong of pink, here a streak of yellow,' and paint it just as it looks to you, the exact color and shape, until it gives you your own impression of the scene before you." -Claude Monet
