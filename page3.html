<p1> What's the point of this website? Why did you just read a whole bunch of information about the deeper meaning of art?
Well, art is a form. A form that has been worked on since the beginning of times, since the cavemen were here. Art has evolved in such a powerful way to not only the artist but the viewer. A piece can take up to years to complete and in
those years an artist can learn so much about not only their style of art but about themselves. When looking at art we
often feel a certain emotion. Sometimes we are sad, sometimes confused, and sometimes we feel at ease. Certain pieces of art give us different feelings in what we are seeing and with Claude Monet people tend to feel peaceful. Viewers tend to look at the tiny brush strokes and the precise take to detail and just look in awe.

There aren't 'secret' codes behind art, no messages, art is just expressive. The art can express the way one feels mentally, emotionally, or physically. Art is used all around the world in many shapes and forms. Each artist has their own story, along with their art as well. Claude Monet is an impressionists artist and like stated before there's so much art around the world. For example, the art in Japan in the art period. People often painted objects and scenes right in front of their eye. There's lots of work in the world that is similar to Claude Monets but never really get that same emotion.
