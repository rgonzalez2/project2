Woman with a Parasol (1875)</a> shows the accessory of women using parasols to block the sunlight from damaging their face and eyes. Monet using the parasol quite often in his works because women used this accessory so much in the 1800’s to protect their image. What really makes this piece of art more deeper isn’t the fact that women worry about their image or that the parasol is something symbolic. What makes this piece much more if the way it is painted. The shading and the light reflecting off her body and creating a shadow is something many artists back in the day didn’t attempt because it was too difficult so when Monet attempted and succeed it was something too rare to see. <a href="https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.61379.html"> (Located Here)</a></p5>

<p6> <a href="http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/paintings-analysis/water-lily-pond-monet.htm#analysis"> Water Lilies (1883)</a>

 Monet created multiple paintings of just one bridge. He painted each one by a different view every time, 18 views to be exact. Water Lilies is one of Monet's most well-known paintings because it started his whole recognition of being an impressionist artist.  Monet painted this bridge so many times and wanted it to be beautiful each time he painted it that he had gardeners tend to it often and imported lilies from Japan. At first glance, you just see a painted bridge with lilies underneath with flowers around but the thing about this is that there’s not really meaning. It’s the fact that there can be such beauty in the simplest things and Claude Monet caught it multiple times. He put so much effort into this scenery and the painting. This bridge ended up being a place he went so often because he grew attach to such a beautiful place. (No Exhibit) </p6>
 
 <p7> <a href="https://www.claude-monet.com/camille-monet-on-her-deathbed.jsp"> Camille on her deathbed (1879)</a>
This is by hand one of Monet's saddest pieces. His then current wife Camille Monet was lying on her deathbed waiting for her life to go out. She died at the age of 32 and married Monet at 18 while he was 25. This piece captures the grief and sadness of his emotions perfectly. The shadows upon her face show well with the dark purples and grays on her sheets and face. The light upon her face casts a sad shadow on her blanket. That same year Camille Monet had passed away from pelvic cancer. Monet channels the grief of his wife passing in his paintings very well. (No Exhibit )</p7>
